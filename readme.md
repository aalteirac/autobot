# AutoBot

Goal: 
Having robot machine capable of auto-registering itself on the orchestrator

Concept:
A simple script (createMachinbe.ps1), deployed on the robot machine (in master image) calling a little web endpoint (server.js) on the orchestrator machine, API logic is then protected and only server-side
